## Submission Instructions

### Overview

My capstone project is a Inventory Management application. The idea behind this app was inspired from wife. She currently runs a clothing website which features handmade dyed scarfs and sweaters. She sells her items across multiple ecommerce sites and has no way of automatically updating her current quantity of items. This issue causes overselling of items and lost of customer sales. She currently modifies the quantities of all her items across various ecommerce websites which takes up a majority of her time. 

My goal with my project, will be to create a efficient database of her clothing items which will automatically update her current quantity of all of her items on multiple ecommerce sites.

### What I'll Have to Learn

I will need to understand how to accurately use CRUD operations within my project using java. I will also need to learn how to incorporate BootStrap elements into my project for the front-end interactivity. I'm not sure how to go about sending information from the database to another ecommerce site. I feel this will be important to understand inorder to accurately update current database information other sites.
